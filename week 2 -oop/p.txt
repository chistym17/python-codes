In this example, the factorial_helper function is defined as an inner function within the factorial function.
This function is only used to calculate the factorial of a number,it is isolated from the rest of the code. This makes the code easier to read and understand,
as it allows us to focus on the main logic of the factorial function without having to worry aboutthe implementation of the error handling code.
